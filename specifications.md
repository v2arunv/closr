For frontend practical test, please see below instructions and revert back with a result link for our further review. There is no time limitation on this test. 

## Task:
1.   Given the public API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
2.   Write a UI of your choice: iOS, Android or Web.
3.   Put the code into a GitHub repository and provide us with a link and instructions on how to start the application.
4.   Please, provide your submission as quickly as possible.
 
Some further clarification on the task.
 
### What's the judging criteria?
 
* Cleanness of code
* Ease of use/navigation
* Look and feel
* creativeness
 
### We are to decide all the APIs by ourselves? What number of it is expected/preferred?
 
The API should be this: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
It is a simple social network app.
Users have posts and photo albums and a todo list
Posts have comments.
Photo albums have photos.
We don’t want to be too restrictive regarding how the data gets presented.
An example app could look like (but is not restricted to):
 
* Have a top level list of users.
* Click a user widget and get to the user details page.
* Have another button to show the address
* Have a section for photo album
* Have a section for todo’s
* Have a section for posts.
* Each section navigates to the respective details view.
* Navigating back up the UI tree should be possible.
 
### Any preferred types of apps/webs or problem domains? e.g. a timer vs. an info site
 
We would prefer a mobile app over a web app. Otherwise see above. If it runs in an emulator that is fine.

3rd party UI framework is not allowed for the coding test.
